# Social-link
A simple single-page webpage that holds all of your social links and a brief description about you with your pic and a bg-image.   
***note: This is not a responsive site, only for smartphones***

## For Windows
* clone my repo, `git clone https://github.com/itsatulya/Social-link.git`
* change the directory to the root directory, `cd Social-link`
* move out all the files from ***public*** (it will help post).

## Customizing
* ***Name, Intro, Social media Links*** : Fill all the fields ***(name,intro and social media links)*** mentioned in [index.html](https://github.com/itsatulya/Social-link/blob/6e234fb1c517fbe9b095b7a290e191f0b556e170/public/index.html) in ***line 12, 13, 19, 20, 21, 22*** respectively.
* ***Profile Picture*** : create a circle pic, [here](https://crop-circle.imageonline.co/) and move it to root folder and then edit ***line 11*** in [index.html](https://github.com/itsatulya/Social-link/blob/6e234fb1c517fbe9b095b7a290e191f0b556e170/public/index.html).

## Hosting for free
For this project I personally prefer [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for hosting this webpage on as its ***free*** and quite fast for this webpage.
for hosting refer to this ***not mine*** [YouTube Video](https://youtu.be/w7xKZ5PWizs).
